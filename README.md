# 7zExtract
This repository is dedicated to a very small C++ library _7zExtract_.
This library can be used to gather information or extract files from **_7z_ archives**.

It uses the **LZMA SDK** under the hood, to make everything possible.
Thanks a lot to **Igor Pavlov** for his incredible work.

You can find any information about this SDK [here](https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html).
